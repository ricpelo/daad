
The new GFX assignements are:-

GFX pa opt
where option can be

       0       Back->Phys
       1       Phys->Back
       2       SWAP (Phys<>Back) (In CGA this is a bit rough...)
       3       Graphics Write to Phys
       4       Graphics Write to Back
       5       Clear Phys
       6       Clear Back
       7       Text Write to Phys      -ST only
       8       Text Write to Back      -ST only
       9       Set Palette value (Value is offset of 4 flag data block
               containing Num,Red,Green,Blue. RGB values are 0-255
      10       Read Palette value (Value is offset of 4 flag data block)

N.B. SWAP in CGA is so slow as it uses the processor, there is no real
page switching so you may want to code for that special case (ScMode=4)

9 and 10 use the first GFX parameter 'pa' to point at a four flag data block:-

0 - palette no
1 - RED 0-255
2 - GREEN 0-255
3 - BLUE 0-255

Note that our machines only use the most significant bits. E.g
PC the top 6, ST the top 3 and Amiga the top 4! This system allows the same
numbers to represent the same colours in each machine.
