Aventura Original - MSX
-----------------------

Lo siento, eso es en ingles...

The supplied IBM disk contains the files needed to make an MSX master

Both parts need the file "dmsxi.z80" - the interpreter.
This is from 0B000h to 0D0AFh
Entry at 0B000h, although your loader must patch the ROMIB and ROMOB
bytes, to give the value for port 0A8h, with ROM and with 64K respectivly.
The program then uses these as needed to switch between the normal mode
of all 64K visible in memory and the lower 32K being ROM. This is
the start of the program:-

	ORG	0B000h

ZZZSTA	JP	INIT
	DEFW	ZZZEND-ZZZSTA	;Length!
EXTVEC	RET			;Extern command patch
	DEFW	0
ROMIB	DEFB	11110000B		;Sony HitBit 64K values
ROMOB	DEFB	11111111B

Then for part 1 the files
PART1.DDB from 0100h to 378Dh	(address' are inclusive)
PART1.MDG from 629Ah to AFFFh

and for part 2
PART2.DDB from 0100h to 4F83h
PART2.MDG from 6CE3h to AFFFh

				*	*	*

Also on the disk is a program called PPM. This allows all the files to be
sent to a machine with 64K in Slot 3 (e.g. Sony HitBit). Merely
PPM PART?
to auto pass and play.
